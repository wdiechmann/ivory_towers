You may do your development in any other way, and I am cool with that - but if you have not grown any serious habits development-wise, this is my way of doing it and you're welcome to copy (that is what I did)!

## Workbench

My workbench has a number of features to it - and I will try to go through them one at a time. They are made up of _hardware_, _tools_, _libraries_ and _work procedures_.

### Hardware

I have two computers - an iMac where I do most of my work, and a Macbook Air that follows me around almost everywhere.

### Tools

#### OS

I went with OSX back in 2005/6 when most of the issues had been ironed out leaving Windows in the dirt and never have I looked back! Coming from *NIX I kind'a knew what I was going into with OSX being _of the ol' UNIX block_ and it has never let me down. No DLL's, a modest amount of 'spinning wheels' (not nearly as much as that of Windows), a brilliant file system, well - you get the picture..

But this means that the rest of this 'workbench talk' is based on me "using" - and if you're on Windows/Linux, you will have to _transpose_ all the time. Please accept my apologies for not adding cross-references :/
 
#### Editors

I use a number of editors; this text for instanse - I am writing it in TextMate. Any editor will do. I use TextMate. You install it 

We decided on building the app on the output from the RailsApp Composer, and this is what we got: [composition]({{ "/installation/composition/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

#### Concurrent Source Code Control

Git

### Libraries
