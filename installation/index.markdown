This _chapter_ covers a range of odd activities ranging from the initial app composition to an installation by an end-user.

## App Composition

We decided on building the app on the output from the RailsApp Composer, and this is what we got: [composition]({{ "/installation/composition/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

## Development

Whether development is anywhere close to development I would not be able to tell but I know that once you've run the initial ```rails new```
command the next thing you most probably will be up to is starting to develop - so here are [a few comments on that subject]({{ "/installation/development/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

## Deployment

After development comes deployment and by now you'd not know me at all did I not have any [remarks to that subject]({{ "/installation/deployment/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) at all!
