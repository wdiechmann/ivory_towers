Deploying Rails Apps is really quite easy - depending upon your setup/requirements. There are online offers like Heruku which more or less removes the hazzle from deployment all together - and then there is customers that require you to deploy to a server farm behind one/more layers of firewall and/or proxies which will take you to that edge of reality where you do not want to go!
