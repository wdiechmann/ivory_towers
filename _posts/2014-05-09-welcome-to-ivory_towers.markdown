This first revelation will not really reveal that much - it is more like a period indicating that something new is coming!

First of, Ivory Towers is what the [acronym][wiki_acronym] IT stands for - and to detail this somewhat please consider [this Wikipedia article on Ivory Tower][wiki_ivory]!

IT is the fabric that ties modern organisations together and helps them excel at what their ambitions are. IT is massive and firm at the foundation and has a sharp pointed tip. 

### Oh - and by the way

The API documentation and user manuals for Ivory Towers are made with the fabulous [Jekyll docs][jekyll] software.
